# Golf-Analytics backend API
The back-end API of the web application "Golf-Analytics".

## What
This is the backend API of "Golf-Analytics" which is an App that uses a sensor to improve professional golf players performance on the field.

## How
Physically the player put our sensor on his club, login to the app, swings, the app gets the swing data of the player, analyzes it, and gives back the speed, angle, approximate distance and even recommends for the best golf club type for him.

Software: I used Django to build a REST API. Used MQTT protocol combined with threads to handle the communication with the sensor.

## Why
Our mission is to develop a low-cost kit that will drastically increase players performances on the field.
